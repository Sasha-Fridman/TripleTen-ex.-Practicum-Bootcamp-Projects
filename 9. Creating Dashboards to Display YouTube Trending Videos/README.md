### Description:

As video ad analysts at Sterling & Draper, we analyze trending YouTube videos to determine which content deserves marketing attention. Each video is categorized (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), includes region info, and can trend for multiple days.

Every week, new employees ask:
- what video categories trended last week?
- how were they distributed among regions?
- which categories were popular in the U.S.?

To automate this, weâ€™re creating a dashboard. After consulting with managers and database admins, we have the following requirements:

**Business goal:** analyze trending YouTube videos

**Usage frequency:** daily

**Users:** video ads planning managers

**Dashboard content:**
- trending videos by day and category
- trending videos by country
- correspondence table of categories and countries

**Data grouping:**
- date and time
- category
- country

**Data details:**
- trending history (absolute and percentage values)
- events by country (% values)
- category-country correspondence (table)

**Importance:** all graphs are equally important

**Data source:** an aggregate table (trending_by_time .csv)

**Update interval:** every 24 hours
